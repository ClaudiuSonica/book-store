# Novel Nook Project

Welcome to my Book Store project! In this README, I'll provide an overview of what I've learned and the technologies I utilized to build this project.

## Learning Highlights

Throughout this project, I've gained valuable insights and hands-on experience in several key areas:

### React

I extensively employed React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. By breaking down the UI into reusable components, I improved the maintainability and scalability of my project. This project allowed me to delve into React's component lifecycle, state management, and props system.

### SCSS (Sass)

Styling is an essential aspect of any web project. To enhance my project's design and structure, I utilized SCSS, a powerful extension of CSS. SCSS's features, such as variables, nesting, and mixins, enabled me to write cleaner and more organized stylesheets.

### Atomic Design

For a systematic and organized UI architecture, I embraced the Atomic Design methodology. By breaking down components into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages, I established a structured design system that promotes consistency and reusability.

### Flex Positioning

Flex positioning emerged as a go-to solution for responsive layout design. Implementing flexible box layouts using Flexbox allowed me to create dynamic and adaptive designs that adjust to various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- React
- SCSS (Sass)
- Atomic Design
- Flexbox

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/claudiusonica/book-store.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd book-store`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`

## Project Structure

The project adheres to the Atomic Design methodology for component organization:

- `src/components`: Contains atomic-level components (atoms, molecules, organisms).
- `src/templates`: Houses templates that combine components for specific sections.
- `src/pages`: Represents higher-level pages composed of templates and components.
